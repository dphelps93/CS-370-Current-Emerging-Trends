# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

This project showed our ability to create an AI agent that could traverse a given maze to completion and obtain the treasure. We were given code from the Treasure Maze and Game Experience files, as well as code given to create the neural network and run the test. The code we developed implemented a learning algorithm that allowed for the AI to achieve a 100% success rate. 

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
* What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  * A computer scientist is responsible for developing easier ways of doing things. This includes creating AI to help with daily task, or that can solve complex problems that can lead to cures to cures in the medical field.
* How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  * I approach problems by analyzing what expected results we are trying to achieve. I then take this and develop an initial problem and begin to break that down further into more basic problems and try to solve those. We do this as building blocks until we get to a solution that fits the big problem.
* What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  * My ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist are to develop secure code that is bias free and is functional for the problem I am solving. I should never feed Neural Networks malicious data or create anything that may harm, discriminate, or violate a person or their private information.
